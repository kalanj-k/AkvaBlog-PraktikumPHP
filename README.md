# AkvaBlog-PraktikumPHP

A school project of a website for a blog focused on aquarium life.  
The website is dynamic, with front-end and back-end validation used for every form.  
The landing page is used to log-in, and after doing so the user has access to other pages. A regular user is redirected to his own account, 
while an admin is redirected to the admin page, which has information about logged users, which pages they're visiting, and everything else that's on the website. Admins can 
also download an Excel spreadsheet which contains information about the website's users.  
Users are able to create new posts, update or delete them, as well as change their profile pictures. They are able to filter through the posts of others and comment on them.
